# Weather App - Streamlined City Search ‚õÖÔ∏è üå©Ô∏è üåû

## Introduction

This README file provides information about the latest update, which brings a significant enhancement to the user experience based on AlTayeb Ahmad's suggestion.

## Streamlined City Search

### Overview

In the basic version of the app, users had to navigate to a separate City Page to input the city name. AlTayeb proposed a more streamlined approach by removing the City Page entirely. Now, users can perform all location-related tasks directly on the Home Page.

### Implementation

The City Page has been removed, and a text field for city search is now accessible directly from the Home Page. When the user clicks on the Search Icon, a text field appears, allowing them to input the desired city name and initiate the weather search.

### How it Works

1. **Home Page Interaction**: Users click on the Search Icon on the Home Page.

2. **City Input Field**: A text field appears, enabling users to input the city name.

3. **Weather Search**: Users enter the city name and trigger the weather search directly from the Home Page.
