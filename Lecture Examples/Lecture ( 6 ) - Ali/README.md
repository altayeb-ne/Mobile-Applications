# Weather App - AutoComplete Feature ‚õÖÔ∏è üåû

## Introduction

This README file provides information about the latest update, incorporating an AutoComplete feature for the City Page, thanks to the valuable suggestion from Ali Shaker.

## AutoComplete Feature

### Overview

In the basic version of the app, users were required to manually input the city name on the City Page. Ali Shaker suggested an improvement by enabling the AutoComplete feature, making it more user-friendly and efficient.

### Implementation

To achieve this enhancement, we have integrated the Geonames API for AutoComplete functionality. The Geonames API provides a reliable source for location data, making it easier for users to find and select their desired city.

### How it Works

1. **City Page Interaction**: Users can start typing the city name in the input field on the City Page.

2. **AutoComplete Suggestions**: As the user types, the app communicates with the Geonames API to retrieve matching city suggestions.

3. **User Selection**: Users can select their desired city from the AutoComplete suggestions, streamlining the process of entering location information.

## Feedback and Contributions

We appreciate Ali Shaker's valuable suggestion and welcome feedback from all Students. If you encounter any issues, have ideas for improvement, or want to contribute, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy exploring the enhanced Weather app with the AutoComplete feature!
